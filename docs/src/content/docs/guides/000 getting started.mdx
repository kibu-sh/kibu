<Aside type="tip" title="Kibu is in Alpha">
  Discern has been using Kibu since 2022.
  We're excited to share this with the community.

  Please keep in mind that we are actively porting this code from a closed source repo.
  Part of this project is implementing new features that we want for ourselves and are excited to build with the community.

  Until we reach a public 1.0 release, these guides may change in backwards incompatible ways.

# I want to skip the tutorial
If you're eager to see the outcome of this tutorial,
jump straight to our [templates' repo](https://github.com/kibu-sh/templates).


# Starting from scratch
<Steps>

1. Start a new go project

   ```shell
   mkdir example
   cd example
   go mod init example
   ```

2. Install kibu's base tool chain

    ```shell
    go install github.com/google/wire/cmd/wire@latest
    go install github.com/kibu-sh/kibu/internal/toolchain/kibugenv2/cmd/kibugenv2@main
    go install github.com/kibu-sh/kibu/internal/toolchain/kibuwire/cmd/kibuwire@main
    ```

3. Jump start the project structure
    ```shell
    # this will be our code generation entrypoint
    touch generate.go

    # we need a place to put our first service
    mkdir -p src/backend/systems/health/services
    touch src/backend/systems/health/health.go
    ```
</Steps>


## Let's write a simple service interface in Kibu

`src/backend/systems/health/health.go`

```go
package health

import (
	"context"
)

type CheckRequest struct {}

type CheckResponse struct {
  Message string `json:"message"`
}

// Activities stub until bug is fixed
//kibu:activity
type Activities interface{}

// Service checks the health of the entire system
//
//kibu:service
type Service interface {
  // Check returns a message letting us know the service is alive
  //
  //kibu:service:method method=GET
  Check(ctx context.Context, req CheckRequest) (res CheckResponse, err error)
}
```

## Now, generate some plumbing

`generate.go`
```go
package generate

// analyze each module and generate system plumbing code
//go:generate kibugenv2 ./...

// execute a second pass to generate wire superset
//go:generate kibuwire ./...
```

```shell
go generate generate.go
```

Two new files have manifested
System plumbing for the interfaces we defined.
`src/backend/systems/health/health.gen.go`

A managed wire superset of all the `//kibu:provider` directives in the system.
At scale, kibu makes managing wire sets a breeze across hundreds of services.
`kibuwire/kibuwire.gen.go`
