import { FileTree } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

This is our recommended project structure.
While kibu doesn't enforce this specific structure, we recommend this for long term maintainability.

<FileTree>
  - docker-compose.core.yaml
  - docker-compose.yaml
  - go.mod
  - go.sum
  - kibu.go
  - src/
    - backend/
      - cmd/
        - server/ this is where your main.go lives
      - database/
        - migrations/
        - models/
        - queries/
      - systems/
        - billingv1/
          - **billingv1.go** your interfaces go here
          - activities/ implementations go in these subdirectories
          - services/
          - workflows/
        - ... many more systems
      - gen/
        - kibuwire/ kibu generates a wire super set
</FileTree>
