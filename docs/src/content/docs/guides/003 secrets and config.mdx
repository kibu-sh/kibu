# Managing Secrets &amp; Configurations

## Introduction
Eventually, you will need to manage secrets and configurations in your application. 
This could be API keys, database passwords, or any other sensitive information.
To complicate things further, you will need to manage different configurations for different environments.

1. How do we use configuration in developement?
2. How do we promote configuration between environments?
3. Can we write tests that use secrets and configurations?

## Configuration Store
Its important to manage configuration regardless of its sensitivity in a secure way.
Treating all configuration as sensitive information is a good practice.

We provide a set of tools to manage configuration in a secure way.
### Providers
TODO: add GCP Example
TODO: explain devops and releasing builds with secrets (remote vs packaged)

### CLI
This command will open a file in your editor and wait for it to be released before continuing.
Try adding some JSON data to the file and saving it.
```Bash
export EDITOR="idea -w"
kibu config edit [KEY] -e [ENV]
```

```json
{
  "message": "Hello, secure!ðŸ‘‹"
}
```

You'll notice there's a new, encrypted file in your configuration store.
```
.kibu/store/config/[ENV]/[KEY].enc.json
```

```json
{
	"EncryptionKey": {
		"Engine": "gcpkms",
		"Env": "dev",
		"Key": "projects/[project]/locations/global/keyRings/[keyring]/cryptoKeys/[key]"
	},
	"Data": "[BASE_64_ENCRYPTED_DATA]",
	"Version": 16268448737260137327,
	"CreatedAt": "2024-03-01T14:57:33.123252-07:00",
	"LastModifiedAt": "2024-03-01T14:57:33.123252-07:00"
}
```

Now, you can see the contents in your terminal by running
```Bash
kibu config get [key] -e [env]
```

You should see the data we saved when using the edit command.`

### Code (Go)
You can access these same config objects by using the using the `config.Store` interface.

```go
package main

import (
	"context"
	"github.com/kibu-sh/kibu/pkg/config"
	"github.com/kibu-sh/kibu/pkg/workspace"
)

type Custom struct {
	Message string `json:"message"`
}
func LoadConfig(ctx context.Context, store config.Store) (cfg Custom, err error) {
	_, err = store.GetByKey(ctx,"[key]", &cfg)
	return
}



func main() {
	ctx := context.Background()
	store, err := workspace.DefaultConfigStore("[env]")
	if err != nil {
		panic(err)
	}
	cfg, err := LoadConfig(ctx, store)
	if err != nil {
		panic(err)
	}
	_ = cfg
}
```


### Use Your IDE/Editor to edit configuration
We respect the `EDITOR` environment variable when editing configuration.

Add something like this to your shell profile `$HOME/.zsh_profile`

This example shows checking an environment variable to determine which editor to use.
IDEA will set this variable in your environment when a shell session is started.
Otherwise, we'll fall back to using neovim.

 
```Bash
if [ -n "$IDEA_INITIAL_DIRECTORY" ]; then
  export EDITOR="idea -w"
else
  export EDITOR="nvim"
fi
```
